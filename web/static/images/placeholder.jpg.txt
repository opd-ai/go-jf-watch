# Placeholder Image

This would contain a placeholder image for media items without thumbnails.

In a real implementation, this would be a small PNG or SVG image showing:
- A film/TV icon
- Gray background
- "No Image Available" text

For development/testing purposes, the UI will handle missing images gracefully.
